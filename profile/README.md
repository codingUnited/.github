   ## Purpose
   
   Introductory meeting for the Physical Roku Remote project‚Äôs hardware setup. Focus was on preparing the environment, confirming software installs, and demonstrating the basic breadboard and ESP32 wiring process ahead of next week‚Äôs hands-on build.
   
   ### üõ†Ô∏è Key Topics Covered
   
   **1. Recording and Attendance**
     - Meetings have varied attendance; this one was a smaller group (Jose, Dylan, Tony).
     - Several members requested recordings for later viewing.
   <br>
   
   **2. Software Setup ‚Äî Arduino IDE**
     - Demonstrated how to download and install the Arduino IDE on Ubuntu/Linux.
     - Explained that installation can be done by extracting the .zip and running directly, or by adding a command/script for quick launch later.
     - Confirmed Arduino IDE will be used for all ESP32 programming.
    <br>
    
   **3. Arduino Code Structure Overview**
     - Introduced the setup() and loop() structure, comparing it to Unity game development loops.
     - setup() runs once to initialize; loop() runs continuously, reacting to input signals.
   <br>
   
   **4. Hardware Overview**
     - Showed a breadboard and explained internal metal connections.
     - Emphasized inserting components firmly to ensure good electrical contact.
     - Demonstrated placement of the ESP32 chip straddling the center gap on the breadboard.
     - Wires and buttons were connected to GPIO pins D13, D14, D26, D25, and D23.
   <br>
   
   **5. ESP32 Power and Connectivity**
     - Connected ESP32 to computer using the micro-USB cable (power LED indicator verified).
     - Explained that code runs on the ESP32 itself, which then communicates over USB serial back to the PC.
   <br>
   
   **6. Basic Signal Test**
     - Demonstrated a small script that checks for button signals via the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE.
     - Pressing button wired to pin 33 toggled output from 1 (false) ‚Üí 0 (true).
     - Updated code to test pin 25 and verified signal detection on another button.
     - Confirmed the setup properly detects individual button presses.
   <br>
   
   ### üìÖ Next Steps (for Next Week)
   
   - Share test code with participants.
   - Each member wires their own ESP32 + breadboard (using buttons and jumper wires).
   - Verify button inputs through Serial Monitor.
   - Begin structured build of the physical remote.
   
   ### Action Items
   
   - All members: Install Arduino IDE and ensure ESP32 drivers are working.
   - Jose: Provide script for button test and setup guide.
   - Next meeting: Begin actual breadboard assembly and input testing.
   
   ### Summary:
   This was the kickoff session for the Physical Roku Remote hardware build. Members set up their development environment, learned the ESP32 basics, and previewed next week‚Äôs task ‚Äî wiring buttons and verifying input signals via serial communication.
