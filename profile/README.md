We're not just learning to code — we're building something bigger.

**Coding United** is a student-led tech club where developers, data minds, and curious thinkers come together to:

* 🚀 Build ambitious, real-world projects
* 🛠️ Explore tools, ideas, and emerging technologies
* 🤝 Support one another in class, code, and community

Whether you're into cybersecurity, data, game dev, or just getting started — there's a place for you here.

🎯 **Learn. Create. Evolve. Together.**

* Learn the [Jargon](https://www.computerscience.org/bootcamps/guides/coding-jargon/): Don’t know what a word means? That’s normal. This guide helps you look up coding terms you’ll run into. AI tools ([ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)) are great for breaking stuff down too.

* List of resource links to help learn, look up information, mini coding practices and more:
  * [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions) The Google of coding. Ask questions or search for answers—someone else has definitely run into the same problem before.
  * [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/): Don’t just have AI do the work for you. Ask it to explain the code, teach you how it works, or walk you through a bug. AI is a powerful tutor—if you use it right.
  * [Exercism](https://exercism.org/): Practice solving small coding challenges in dozens of languages. Get feedback and tips as you go. Great for building confidence.
  * [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) – Simple tutorials for web dev stuff like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. Easy to follow, with live code examples.
  * [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) – 100% free. Learn by building real projects, step by step. Great for web dev, Python, and even data science.
  * [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) – Interactive lessons in a bunch of languages. Some free, some paid. Great for absolute beginners.
  * [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) – When you're ready to level up, this is where you go to prep for interviews and improve problem-solving skills.
  * [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) – A full web development curriculum. Totally free, self-paced, and really well organized
  * [CS50 from Harvard](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science) – A free, high-quality intro to computer science. It's tough but super rewarding—and you’ll learn how to think like a developer.

## 📚 Learing Resources
* 💻 Start your coding journey - All links are to oreilly courses free if you create an account with SNHU.

  *  [Python](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/python-fundamentals-with/9780135917411/) - The easiest language to start with. This is your intro to programming at SNHU. If you’ve never written code before, start here.

  *  [Java](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/learn-java-from/9781838556976/) - Big companies use this every day. It runs a lot of the internet and Android apps. You’ll take this as your second programming class at SNHU.

  *  [C++](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/programming-c/9781926873411/) - Used for building things like robots, fast programs, and even video games with high-end graphics. Your third language class at SNHU.
 
  *  [HTML/CSS](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/-/9781835082447/) - This is how websites are made. HTML builds the page, CSS makes it look good. If you’ve ever visited a website (you have), it was made with these.
    
  *  [Javascript](https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/-/9781788838139/) - This makes websites do stuff. Buttons, animations, forms, games—if it moves or reacts, this is the magic behind it.
    
  *  [C#](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/learning-path-c/9780134667591/) - A lot like Java, but used mostly in video games made with Unity. If you’re into game development, this is your jam.
    
  *  [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1191075909/editor) - Drag-and-drop coding made for beginners. No typing, just learning how code thinks. Even top schools like Harvard and MIT use it to teach.
 
  *  [SQL](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/mysql-5/9781926873961/) -  Every app or website needs to store stuff—users, scores, posts, whatever. SQL is the language that talks to the database.
    
  *  [Git/GitHub](https://learning.oreilly.com/course/complete-git-guide/9781800209855/) - This is how coders save their work and share it with others. Like Google Docs, but for code—with a time machine.
