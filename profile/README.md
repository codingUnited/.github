**We're not just learning to code, we're building something bigger.**

<br>

**Coding United** is a student-led technology club where developers, data minds, and innovators come together to:

- Build ambitious, real-world projects
- Explore tools, ideas, and emerging technologies
- Support one another in class, code, and community

Whether you’re interested in AI, embedded systems, full-stack apps, or just getting started, there’s a place for you here.

**Learn. Create. Evolve. Together.**

## Club Mission

Coding United exists to help students grow from learners into engineers through hands-on collaboration and cross-disciplinary learning.
Our mission is to make technical education practical, team-driven, and career-ready, by turning concepts into working projects and connecting classroom knowledge to real industry workflows.

## Core Development Tracks


### 🧠 AI / Machine Learning Track

**Goal**: Build intelligence into software and systems.
**Focus Areas**:

- Python → Data Science → Machine Learning → Applied AI
- Model training, data visualization, prompt engineering
- Tools: scikit-learn · PyTorch · TensorFlow · OpenAI API
  **Example Project**: AI Chatbot

### ⚙️ Robotics / Embedded & IoT Track

**Goal**: Bridge software with real hardware.
**Focus Areas**:

- Microcontrollers (Arduino · ESP32 · micro:bit)
- Sensors · Actuators · Networking · ROS2 Simulations
- IoT communication (HTTP, MQTT, WebSocket)
  **Example Project**: Physical Roku Remote (ESP32 Wi-Fi Control)

### 💻 Full-Stack / Software Engineering Track

**Goal**: Build full production-grade applications from front to back.
**Focus Areas**:

- React · Next.js · Tailwind · Django · Docker
- Databases (PostgreSQL / MongoDB) and API design
- DevOps fundamentals and deployment pipelines
  **Example Project**: Club Website (Mokse Rebuild)

## How We Work

Coding United emphasizes project-based learning and collaborative development.
Members learn by:

- Pairing up on active builds tied to one of the three tracks
- Participating in monthly coding challenges and project demos
- Joining professional-development workshops focused on resumes, portfolios, and GitHub practice

Each project is designed to be:

- **Educational**: reinforces real CS concepts
- **Practical**: built with modern industry tools
- **Collaborative**: open to contributors of all skill levels
