A **FAANG-worthy capstone** isn’t just “a big project” — it’s a mini tech portfolio in one product, proving that the student can think like a real-world engineer.
Here’s what that looks like:

### 🔥 Characteristics of a FAANG-Worthy Capstone

| **Trait**             | **Description**                                                                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Technically Deep**  | Uses real-world tech: full-stack architecture, auth, CI/CD, REST or GraphQL APIs, cloud deployment. |
| **Polished**          | Clean UI, responsive design, testable code, README, documentation, live demo.                       |
| **Scalable Thinking** | Not just functional — shows thought about performance, edge cases, modularity.                      |
| **GitHub History**    | Real commit history (no one-time uploads), branches, issues, pull requests.                         |
| **Problem-Solving**   | Solves a non-trivial problem, ideally one users care about.                                         |

### 🧠 Mindset: You're not building a “school assignment.”

You’re building what a junior software engineer at Amazon or Meta would be expected to ship.
