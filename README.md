## 👾 Coding United Club @ SNHU

> *We are not here to fit in. We are here to build, to learn, and to become.*

Welcome to **Coding United**, a student-led tech club at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU). We’re a community of developers, data nerds, tinkerers, and tech dreamers—united by a shared mission:

🎯 **To face complexity head-on, forge meaning from chaos, and hold each other to the path of growth.**

In this space, all who enter are accepted — not despite their flaws, but because of them. This is not a place for ego or certainty, but for discipline, curiosity, and relentless evolution. Together, we shape what comes next.
