# ü§ù Contributing to Coding United Club Projects

Welcome! We‚Äôre thrilled you‚Äôre interested in contributing to Coding United Club. Your contributions help our community grow and learn. Whether you‚Äôre fixing a bug, proposing a new feature, improving documentation, or helping others, we value your time and curiosity.

## Our Pledge & Code of Conduct

Before contributing, please read our [**Code of Conduct**](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We expect all members and contributors to adhere to it to ensure our community is welcoming and inclusive for everyone.

## üöÄ How to Get Started

1.  **Join the Conversation & Get Oriented:**
    * Introduce yourself on the club's SNHUConnect via [**InScribe**](https://inscribe.education/main/snhu/6754110229506861/coding-united/all-content) or our [**Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/n8xYkS46MG) (if you haven't already!).
    * Check our [**Club Website**](https://coding-united-commons.pages.dev/) or Discord for announcements about project planning sessions or general meetings.
    * Explore our projects:
        * See active club projects listed in our [**Coding United Hub**](https://github.com/codingUnited/coding-united-hub) or browse our [organization's repositories](https://github.com/codingUnited).
        * The main club project is detailed on the [**Club Project Guide Website**](https://club-project-guide.pages.dev/).

2.  **Find Something to Work On:**
    * **Project-Specific Issues:** Navigate to the repository of a project you're interested in and check its "Issues" tab.
    * **Organization Project Boards:** See an overview of tasks on our [**GitHub Project Boards**](https://github.com/orgs/codingUnited/projects).
    * **Beginner-Friendly Tasks:** Look for issues labeled `good first issue`, `help wanted`, or `documentation`. These are great starting points!
    * **Have an Idea?** If you have a new idea or want to suggest a feature, feel free to open an issue on the relevant repository or discuss it on Discord first.

3.  **Set Up Your Workspace & Code:**
    * **Fork or Branch:**
        * **Fork** the repository if you are not a direct collaborator on the repository or if you want to make significant changes on your own copy first.
        * **Create a new branch** from the `main` (or `develop`) branch if you have write access to the repository. This is the typical workflow for club members working on shared projects.
    * **Branch Naming:** Follow clear naming conventions (e.g., `feature/new-user-signup`, `fix/navbar-alignment-bug`, `docs/update-readme-section`).
    * **Development Environment:** Follow any setup instructions in the project-specific `README.md` or our provided templates ([Python Template](https://github.com/codingUnited/python-template), [Docker Template](https://github.com/codingUnited/docker-template)).

4.  **Code, Commit, and Comment:**
    * Write clear, readable, and maintainable code.
    * Add helpful comments where necessary to explain complex logic.
    * Keep your commits focused and logical. Use concise, meaningful commit messages.
    * Follow any project-specific guidelines, linters, or style guides mentioned in its `README.md`.

5.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):**
    * Push your changes to your fork or branch on GitHub.
    * Open a Pull Request against the `main` (or `develop`, confirm the project's standard) branch of the original repository.
    * Provide a clear title and description for your PR:
        * Explain *what* you‚Äôve changed and *why*.
        * Link the related issue(s) using keywords like "Closes #123" or "Fixes #456".
    * If your PR is a work in progress, consider creating a [Draft Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request#converting-a-pull-request-to-a-draft).
    * Tag relevant reviewers or teammates if you know who should look at it, or ask in the project's communication channel.
    * Not sure how to create a PR? Check out [GitHub's guide on creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

6.  **Review and Merge:**
    * Club members or project maintainers will review your PR.
    * Be open to feedback and be prepared to make changes if requested. Discussion is part of the process!
    * Once your PR is approved, it will be merged into the project. Congratulations!
